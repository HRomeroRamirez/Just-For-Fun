# Just-For-Fun Projects: GSCPI

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI), a measure that has been normalized to have an average value of zero over the full time series.
This project re-scales the GSCPI to a positive index with a base value of 100 in December 2006, making it easier to interpret in percentage terms and use in comparative analysis.
The sample covers the period from January 1998 to April 2025.
You can find the original data on the New York Fed's website:â€¨ðŸ‘‰ https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/interactive
